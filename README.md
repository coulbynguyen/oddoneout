# oddoneout
This program finds the number that doesn't belong i.e. the odd number in an array of even numbers, or vice versa<br/>
This program would be useful as a program that can used as a basis for another odd one out function<br/>
Only needing to change what condition needs to be met<br/>
This program checks to see if there are more than one number of the same type, and make that the basis<br/>
Then the number that isn't the same is isolated and returned <br/>
